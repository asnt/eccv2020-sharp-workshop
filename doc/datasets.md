# Datasets

Two new datasets with thousands of 3D textured scans are released as part of
the SHARP competition.

## 3DBodyTex 2

3DBodyTex 2 contains about 3200 human scans.


### 3D body landmarks

The body landmarks are detected automatically on each scan. They are provided
to generate the partial data but can also be used as part of the proposed
method.
They comprise standard body joints and other keypoints on the body (eyes, nose,
ears...). The detection of most landmarks is stable except for the finger
joints which vary in accuracy.


## 3DObjectTex

3DObjectTex contains about 1200 scans of generic objects.
