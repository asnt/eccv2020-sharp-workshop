# Challenge 1: Recovery of Human Body Scans

There are two tracks:

  - [Track 1: Recovery of large regions](challenge_1_track_1.md)
  - [Track 2: Recovery of fine details](challenge_1_track_2.md)

with two complementary datasets.


## 3D body landmarks

The body landmarks are detected automatically on each scan. They are provided
to generate the partial data but can also be used as part of the proposed
method.
They comprise standard body joints and other keypoints on the body (eyes, nose,
ears...). The detection of most landmarks is stable except for the finger
joints which vary in accuracy.
