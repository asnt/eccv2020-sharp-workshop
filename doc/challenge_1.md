# Challenge 1: Recovery of Human Body Scans

There are two tracks:

  - [Track 1: Recovery of large regions](challenge_1_track_1.md)
  - [Track 2: Recovery of fine details](challenge_1_track_2.md)

with two complementary datasets.

## Dataset splits

In each track, the data is split into train/test/eval sets.
In the first stage of the the competition, the train/test sets are provided.
They contain only the ground-truth shapes, `Y`.
The partial data, `X` must be generated by the participants.
The eval set is provided at a later stage of the competition to generate the
submission for the final evaluation.
In this set, the ground-truth shapes, `Y`, are kept secret until the end of the
competition.
Only some pregenerated partial data, `X`, is shared.


## 3D body landmarks

The body landmarks are detected automatically on each scan. They are provided
to generate the partial data but can also be used as part of the proposed
method.
They comprise standard body joints and other keypoints on the body (eyes, nose,
ears...). The detection of most landmarks is stable except for the finger
joints which vary in accuracy.
